I enjoy building things that I can understand, control, and improve over time. Lately, that has meant spending a lot of time working with self-hosted systems such as home servers, automation, and local applications. I like learning how modern infrastructure actually works by running real systems rather than relying entirely on managed services. This site is a place for me to document projects I’ve built, what motivated them, and what I learned along the way.
